# HDF
Archiving my old code samples and tutorials for HDF5 and netCDF, from my time working with the HDF Group.

This repo contains [beautifully written] C, FORTRAN, and PYTHON sample codes to demonstrate how to use the HDF5 and netCDF4 APIs.

Compilation instructions are (were?) dependent on how HDF was installed, so you may or may not need the -lsz in the compile commands. 

Samples were created between 2010 and 2011. Therefore, it is entirely possible that the API has changed to a point where the code samples are deprecated, obsolete, and/or require porting.
